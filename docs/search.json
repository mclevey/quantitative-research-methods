It will introduce students to the quantitative research process, hypothesis development and testing, and the application of appropriate tools for analyzing quantitative data. All sections of this course count towards the HSS Quantitative Reasoning Requirement (see mun.ca/hss/qr).\n(PR: SOCI 1000 or the former SOCI 2000)\n\nThis section of SOCI 3440 is an introduction to quantitative research methods, from planning an analysis to sharing the final results. Following the workflow from Rohan Alexander‚Äôs (2023) Telling Stories with Data, you will learn how to:\n\n\n\n\n\nRohan Alexander‚Äôs (2023) Telling Stories with Data is required reading in this course. You can purchase a print copy or read it online for free.\n\n\n\nplan an analysis and sketch your data and endpoint\nsimulate some data to ‚Äúforce you into the details‚Äù\nacquire, assess, and prepare empirical data for analysis\nexplore and analyze data by creating visualizations and fitting models\nshare the results of your work with the world!\n\nYou will use this workflow in the context of learning foundational quantitative research skills, including conducting exploratory data analyses and fitting, assessing, and interpreting linear models, generalized linear models, and multilevel models. Reproducibility and research ethics are considered throughout the workflow, and the entire course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Quarto üòÅ ‚Äì No Experience Necessary\n\n\n\nYou will learn to use R (a free/open source programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics) and Quarto (a free/open source publishing system for creating dynamic and reproducible manuscripts, reports, websites, and presentations) in this course. Note that I assume no prior experience with R or Quarto. Everything you need to know about both will be introduced in the course. While some prior programming experience is an asset, it is by no means necessary.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nExplain key principles, concepts, and methods in quantitative research.\nFormulate quantitative research questions, outline analysis plans, and sketch data analysis endpoints.\nObtain datasets from common sources (e.g., data repositories, APIs).\nProcess, store, and share data.\nConduct purposeful exploratory data analyses.\nFit, assess, and interpret linear models, generalized linear models, and multilevel models.\nUse R and Quarto (properly) to make your quantitative research fully reproducible.\nUnderstand the essential role and implications of ethics in quantitative research.\nüî• Tell compelling and credible stories with data.\n\nMore specific learning objectives can be found in the lecture and lab materials for each class meeting."
