title: Workflow
---

**Workflow** refers to a structured, step-by-step process for conducting research from start (e.g., planning) to finish (e.g., communicating). Formal workflows offer significant benefits, such as making it easier to conduct trustworthy and reproducible research. In [*Telling Stories with Data*](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com), Rohan Alexander (2023) introduces a straightforward workflow that begins with planning the analysis, simulating data, acquiring real data, and then exploring and analyzing it, and finally sharing the results. This workflow, shown in @fig-workflow, encourages us to think critically at each stage of the process, and to focus on reproducibility, research ethics, and effective communication.
